        What is the true indication of a great physique? Is it large, peaked biceps? Is it razor-sharp abs? Is it bowling-ball shoulders or a wide thick back? None of those are correct. The real answer is, symmetry. A "Symmetrical Physique" is one in which all body parts flow into each other. No one body part or side of the body is bigger than the other. 
        <br>  
      If this is an article about building legs, why am I talking to you about symmetry? I'm getting there. I brought up symmetry because too many beginners skip out on leg-training (or just do a half-ass job of it) and build a horrible imbalance between the size of their upper and lower body. This completely throws off the symmetry of one's physique. There is nothing more ridiculous than to see a guy in the gym with a well-developed upper body with toothpick legs.
       <br> 
      Today you are going to start down a new road, a journey which few make and even fewer survive. The path will be clearly set out before you by the words in this article. The journey will be hard, harder than anything you have ever done before, but once you see the results you will continue this journey of leg training for life.

   <h3>1.Barbell Squat</h3>
   <img src="images\legs2.jpg">
  <img src="images\legs3.jpg">
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Barbell Squat Instructions</h4>  
  <p class="textstyle-1"><b>
    1.Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed.<br>
    <br>
    2.Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible.<br>
    <br>
    3.Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward.<br>
    <br>
  </b>
  <br>
<h3>2.Dumbbell Lunges</h3>
   <img src="images\legs4.jpg">
  <img src="images\legs5.jpg">
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Dumbbell Lunges Instructions</h4>  
  <p class="textstyle-1"><b>
   1.Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position.<br>
   <br>
   2.Step forward with your right leg around 2 feet or so from the foot being left stationary behind and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. <b>Note</b>: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground.<br>
   <br>
   3.Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.<br>
   <br>
   4.Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.<br>
   <br></b>
   <span class="textstyle-2">Caution:</span>This is a movement that requires a great deal of balance so if you suffer from balance problems you may wish to either avoid it or just use your own bodyweight while holding on to a fixed object. Definitely never perform with a barbell on your back if you suffer from balance issues.<br>
   <br>
   <span class="textstyle-2">Variation:</span>There are several ways to perform the exercise.
<br>
One way is to alternate each leg. For instance do one repetition with the right, then the left, then the right and so on.
<br>
The other way is to do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same.
<br>
A more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes.
<br>
Lunges can be performed with dumbbells as described above or with a barbell on the back, though the barbell variety is better suited for the advanced athletes who have mastered the exercise and no longer have balance issues.

<h3>3.Leg Press</h3>
   <img src="images\legs6.jpg">
  <img src="images\legs7.jpg">
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Leg Press Instructions</h4>  
  <p class="textstyle-1"><b>
    1.Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).<br>
    <br>
    2.Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.<br>
    <br>
    3.As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.<br>
    <br>
    4.Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.<br>
    <br>
    5.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="textstyle-2">Caution:</span>Always check to make sure that when you re-rack the weight the platform is securely locked.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>4.Lying Leg Curls</h3>
   <img src="images\legs8.jpg">
  <img src="images\legs9.jpg">
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Lying Leg Curls Instructions</h4>  
  <p class="textstyle-1"><b>
    1.Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie face down on the leg curl machine with the pad of the lever on the back of your legs (just a few inches under the calves). Tip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment.<br>
    <br>
    2.Keeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position.<br>
    <br>
    3.As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second<br>.
    <br>
    As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    <br></b>
    <br>
    <span class="textstyle-2">Caution:</span>Do not ever use so much weight on the exercise that you start using swinging and jerking as you can risk both lower back injury and also a hamstring injury.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="textstyle-2">Variations:</span>Since you have three foot positions you have in reality three exercises. The movement can also be performed with a dumbbell held in between your feet (a partner needs to place it properly). This latter exercise though is only suitable for advanced trainees. Finally, it is also possible to just use one leg at a time for better isolation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>5.Leg Extensions</h3>
   <img src="images\legs10.jpg">
  <img src="images\legs11.jpg">
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Leg Extensions Instructions</h4>  
  <p class="textstyle-1"><b>
  1.For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.<br>
  <br>
  2.Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position.<br>
  <br>
  3.Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.<br>
  <br>
  4.Repeat for the recommended amount of times.</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="textstyle-2">Variations:</span>As mentioned at in the foot positioning section, you can use various foot positions in order to maximize stimulation of certain thigh areas. Also, you can perform the movement unilaterally (one leg at a time).
