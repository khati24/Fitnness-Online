    <hr>
    <p id="subhead-1-1">Before you ask your question, just read this article below. What question am I referring to, you might ask? Well, I am referring to the question I get hundreds of times a week from beginners all over this great world of ours. "How can I get my arms bigger?"</p>
    <img src="images\arms1.jpg">
</div>
<p class="textstyle-1">
	I don't mind answering these questions at all but I decided it was time for me to put all my knowledge on this subject into one of my articles for Bodybuilding.com. This way anyone can have a detailed blueprint of how to start the process of building HUGE arms.
      </p>

      <p class="textstyle-1">
        But don't forget that picking great movements is only one part of building a huge back. Your overall program matters just as much! To see these moves put into action, check out the Bodybuilding.com All Access Muscle-Building Workout Plans, where there are killer back workouts from Kris Gethin, Jim Stoppani, and dozens of other elite lifters and coaches.

        <h3 class="textstyle-2">Biceps</h3>
        <br>
        <h4 class="textstyle-2">Biceps Brachii</h4>
        <p class="textstyle-1">
          Location: Front part of the upper arm between the elbow and the shoulder.<br>
          Function: Elbow Flexion, basically making the curling motion.<br>
          Exercises: Barbell and Dumbbell Curls.
          <br>
          <br>

          <h4 class="textstyle-2">Brachialis</h4>
          <p class="textstyle-1">
            Location: Small muscle over the lower portion of the upper arm that connects the bottom half of the bicep to the forearm<br>
Function: Elbow Flexion<br>
Exercise: Hammer Curls and Reverse Curls.<br>
          </p>
        </p>

        <h3 class="textstyle-2">Rep Ranges</h3>
        <p class="textstyle-1">First and foremost let's get something straight. We all know that the biceps are the show muscle for your physique. When someone asks you to show your muscles, 9 times out of 10 you flex your biceps.<br>

It is great to have well developed biceps, but make sure you don't forget to train the rest of your muscles in the upper and lower arm with the same volume and intensity as you do your biceps.<br>

Many beginners fall into that trap and create terrible imbalances in their arms. Even the great Arnold Schwarzenegger admits he trained his biceps harder and more often than his triceps in the beginning. This built an imbalance that took him years to balance back out.<br>

For training your upper arms (biceps and triceps) I like to use all kinds of rep ranges, high (15-20), moderate (8-12) and low (4-6). Each has its own purpose and will be critical to use all ranges in your pursuit of bigger arms.<br>

</p>

<p class="textstyle-1">
  Forearms on the other hand are what I like to call the "burning buggers." You will have to endure some high rep muscle-burning sets to get these babies to grow. Reps can go as high as 50 to get these to burn like they are on fire, but it will be all worth it when you have thick meaty forearms like Popeye.<br>

Now that you understand which muscles make up your arms, their function, location and the rep range needed to stimulate them, let's give you some workouts to help you build your arms.<br>

All exercises should be performed in perfect form because bad form or habits that you start now will follow you and will lead to lack of progress or worse, injury in the future. Many if not all the exercises will be new to you. So make sure you use the Exercise Guide on Bodybuilding.com to help you with your form.<br>
