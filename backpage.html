      <p class="textstyle-1">
        If you get bowled over by the sheer number of rows you can do on back day, or even draw a total blank when thinking of new exercises to try, consider this list your new back blueprint
      </p>
      <p class="textstyle-1">
        But don't forget that picking great movements is only one part of building a huge back. Your overall program matters just as much! To see these moves put into action, check out the Bodybuilding.com All Access Muscle-Building Workout Plans, where there are killer back workouts from Kris Gethin, Jim Stoppani, and dozens of other elite lifters and coaches.

      <div>
        <h3>1. Barbell Deadlift</h3>
        <img src="images\back2.jpg">
        <p class="textstyle-1">
          Stick with the conventional deadlift on back day; other variations, like the popular sumo-style, increase the activity of muscle groups other than the back.

<span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span> If you're going heavy (sets of fewer than about 6 reps), do deadlifts first so you're fresh. If you're doing deads for repetitions, you can do them later in your workout.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Bent-Over Barbell Row</h3>
        <img src="images\back3.jpg">
        <p class="textstyle-1">
          <span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span> Do bent-over rows toward the start of your back workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges, about 6-8 or 8-10. The Smith version is a suitable substitute; it locks you in the vertical plane, but your body has to be in just the right position relative to the bar. The bent-over barbell row has a significantly greater lumbar load than many other back exercises, so it's best done early in your workout in order to save your lower back.[2] If you're wrecked from deadlifts, it may behoove you to skip this movement.
        </p>

        <h3>3.Wide-Grip Pull-Up</h3>
        <img src="images\back4.jpg">
        <p class="textstyle-1">
          <span class="textstyle-2">Why it's on the list:</span> It's always a good idea to have an overhead pulling movement in your back routine, and the pull-up is one of the best. Wide-grip pull-ups are excellent for putting emphasis on the upper lats. A closer grip may allow for a longer range of motion, but it may be possible to load the wide-grip pull-up to a greater degree because of an optimized starting joint position. The biggest challenge here for most trainers is training to failure in the right rep range for growth, which is 8-12.<br>
          <span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span> Because the pull-up range of motion is so long, several light reps make great warm-up moves for the shoulder joints. Since form is so important with these, it may be best to push pull-ups toward the front of your workout to ensure proper shoulder-joint positioning.
        </p>

        <h3>4.Standing T-Bar Row</h3>
        <img src="images\back5.jpg">
        <p class="textstyle-1">
          <span class="textstyle-2">Why it's on the list:</span>We selected the T-bar row over a chest-supported version because you can pile on much more weight here, even though that typically translates into a bit of cheating through the knees and hips. For some, maintaining a flat back can be challenging, in which case the supported version is a better choice.<br>
          <span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span>Do this toward the front half of your workout. Rather than slinging weight around with this movement, really focus on the stretch and contraction of the back. If you're an experienced lifter, load up with 25s instead of the 45s, and further increase range of motion by allowing a slight protraction of the scapula at the bottom of every rep. If you do this, be sure to "reset" with a flat back before initiating the next pull!
        </p>  

        <h3>5.Wide-Grip Seated Cable Row</h3>
        <img src="images\back6.jpg">
        <p class="textstyle-1">
          <span class="textstyle-2">Why it's on the list:</span>Just about everyone defaults to the close-grip bar on rows. If that sounds like you, you'll find using a wide grip on a lat bar a nice change of pace because it shifts some of the emphasis to the upper lats. Wide rows mimic some back machines, so don't do both in your workout unless you make some other kinds of changes, like grip or target rep range. You might even try flipping your grip—and going about shoulder-width apart—which better targets the lower lats as the elbows stay tighter to your sides.<br>
          <span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span>Like machines, cables are best done toward the end of your workout. Choose a weight that enables you to complete no more than about 12 reps.</p>
