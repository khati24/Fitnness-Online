		<p id="subhead-1-1">Have you ever wondered what the absolute best muscle-building movements for your chest are? Wonder no more! Here are our top 10 pec-building picks. </p>
		<hr>
		<img id="image-1" src="images\chest1.jpg">
		<div>
		<p class="textstyle-1">There are dozens of exercises you can do on chest day. In fact, the Bodybuilding.com Exercise Database lists at least 84, but you probably don't want to spend a Monday afternoon—or several Mondays—trying them all. You just want to know the best exercises for building a muscular chest, no questions asked. We've done the work for you, and found the top 10.</p>
		<p class="textstyle-1">This isn't a list of the hardest chest exercises. It's focused on the best-of-the-best mass builders, with a little bit of instruction and explanation to complement each choice. You can swap exercises in your current routine for these choices, build your own chest workout with a handful of them, or just try one when your standard chest workout gets stale.</p>
		<p class="textstyle-1">Knowing the best moves is only one part of building your best chest, though. You can put those moves together into a full program in the Muscle-Building Workout Plans on Bodybuilding.com All Access. There are gym-proven regimens designed to give you size, strength, and definition.</p>
		<p class="textstyle-1">Now, without further ado, here are our top 10 chest-building exercises, ranked in no particular order.</p>

		<h3>1. Barbell Bench Press</h3>
		<p class="textstyle-1">Why it's on the list: You can generate the most power with barbell lifts, so the standard barbell bench allows you to move the most weight. It's also an easier lift to control than pressing with heavy dumbbells. The exercise is easy to spot and relatively easy to learn (if not master), There are plenty of bench-press programs you can follow to increase your strength.</p>
		</div>
		<img src="images\chest2.jpg">
		<p class="textstyle-1">
			<span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span> Do it toward the start of your chest workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges. Consider varying your grip width for more complete chest development.
		</p>
		<h3>2. Flat Bench Dumbbell Press</h3>
		<img src="images\chest3.jpg">
		<p class="textstyle-1"><span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span>Do flat dumbbell presses toward the start of your chest workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges. We don't typically recommend doing dumbbell presses in addition to the barbell bench press, because both moves are so similar.
		</p>

		<h3>3. Low-Incline Barbell Bench Press</h3>
		<img src="images\chest4.jpg">
		<p class="textstyle-1">
			<span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span> Many chest workouts start with flat-bench movements first, then progress to inclines, but it's time to get out of that bad habit. Every so often, start with inclines. The benefit is that you'll be fresher and can lift more weight, which puts a greater amount of stress on the upper pec fibers and could lead to more growth.
		</p>

		<h3>4. Machine Decline Press</h3>
    <img src="images\chest5.jpg">
		<p class="textstyle-1">One of the primary muscle actions of the pec major is transverse adduction—think cable flyes or pec-deck flyes to understand this action. By sitting in a sideways position, you can maximize your press with a pec-dominant horizontal adduction, effectively getting more from the movement.<br>

<span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span> Do free-weight exercises first in your chest workout because they require more effort and stabilizer muscles than machines. With that in mind, this could be the last multijoint exercise in your routine</p>

    <h3>5.Pec-Deck Machine</h3>
    <img src="images\chest6.jpg">
    <p class="textstyle-1">
    Chest flyes are hard for many trainees to learn with dumbbells or cables because the arms need to be locked in a slightly bent position for the duration of the exercise. Luckily, the pec deck simplifies things because it allows you to work in only one pathway. So, this exercise is a great movement teacher, and you can go for a great pump without having to balance any weights.<br>
    
    <span class="textstyle-2">In your workout:</span>Hit the pec deck last in your chest routine for sets of 10-12. Do dropsets and partial reps, pumping out as many as you can to failure.
